1. Introduction
The EMS project is a comprehensive Employee Management System built with a React frontend, Spring Boot backend, and a PostgreSQL database. This documentation guides you through installation, configuration, and usage of the system.
2. Prerequisites
•	Node.js and npm installed
•	Java and Maven installed
•	PostgreSQL database installed
3. Frontend Installation
Clone the frontend repository:
git clone https://github.com/JalaluddinKhafi/EMS-React-and-SpringBoot.git
cd employeemanagement-frontend
npm install

4. Backend Installation
Clone the backend repository:
git clone https://github.com/JalaluddinKhafi/EMS-React-and-SpringBoot.git
cd employeemanagmentbackend
mvn clean install

5. Database Setup
•	Create a PostgreSQL database.
•	Update the database configuration in application.properties of the backend project.
6. Project Structure
•	frontend/src/components: Contains React components for different pages.
•	frontend/src/service: Includes services for interacting with the backend API.
•	frontend/src/App.js: Main application component with route configurations.
•	backend/src/main/java/com/yourcompany: Java packages for Spring Boot backend.
•	backend/src/main/resources: Configuration files for Spring Boot backend.
•	database/schema.sql: SQL script for database schema.

7. Configuration
•	Configure the API endpoint in frontend/src/service/EmployeeService.js and frontend/src/service/DepartmentService.js if necessary.
8. Running the Application
Frontend
cd employeemanagement-frontend
npm install
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Backend
cd employeemanagmentbackend
mvn spring-boot:run
The backend will run on http://localhost:8080.	

9. Routes
/employee: Displays a list of employees.
/add-employee: Allows adding a new employee.
/add-employee/:id: Allows updating an existing employee.
/department: Displays a list of departments.
/add-department: Allows adding a new department.
/add-department/:id: Allows updating an existing department.

12. REST API Endpoints
Employee Endpoints
GET /api/employees: Get all employees.
GET /api/employees/{id}: Get employee by ID.
POST /api/employees: Create a new employee.
PUT /api/employees/{id}: Update an existing employee.
DELETE /api/employees/{id}: Delete an employee.
Department Endpoints
GET /api/departments: Get all departments.
GET /api/departments/{id}: Get department by ID.
POST /api/departments: Create a new department.
PUT /api/departments/{id}: Update an existing department.
DELETE /api/departments/{id}: Delete a department.

13. Backend Configuration
Ensure the application.properties in the backend project has the correct database configuration.
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your-database
spring.datasource.username=your-username
spring.datasource.password=your-password

14. Database Schema
The database schema is defined in “database/schema.sql.” Execute this script to create the required tables and relationships.
psql -U your-username -d your-database -a -f database/schema.sql

15. Styling
Styling for the EMS project is managed using the default CSS stylesheets provided by the React framework. However, feel free to enhance or replace the stylesheets with a styling solution of your choice. The styling is modularized within each React component to ensure maintainability.
16. Testing
The EMS project incorporates testing practices to ensure the reliability and stability of both the frontend and backend components. The testing frameworks used may include:
•	Frontend Testing: React Testing Library, Jest
•	Backend Testing: JUnit, Mockito
To run tests, use the following commands:
Frontend
cd employeemanagement-frontend
npm test

Backend
cd employeemanagmentbackend
mvn test 

17. Deployment
Deploying the EMS project involves setting up the frontend and backend components on a hosting platform. The specific steps may vary depending on your hosting provider. General steps include:
•	Build the frontend application:
cd employeemanagmentbackend
npm run build
•	Deploy the backend Spring Boot application to a server.
•	Configure the server to serve the built frontend application.

18. Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues during installation or runtime, consider the following troubleshooting steps:
Check the console logs for error messages in both the frontend and backend.
•	Ensure that the backend API endpoints are accessible and returning the expected responses.
•	Verify the database connection settings in the backend application.properties file.
•	Refer to the documentation of the specific components or libraries for additional troubleshooting guidance.
